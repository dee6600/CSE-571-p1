    # So the idea of my experimentation is to increase the effect of the heuristic over g value.
    # we cannot reduce the g value because the g value is the cost of the action, so i tried to increase the h value.


    ### Experiemt 1 ###
    ## double the heuristic value

    ### Working Experiemt 2 ###
    ## square the heuristic value

    # regulr A* algorithm for every dimesion and every problem.
